This is my personal blog. Here you'll find any blog posts containing tech related stuff. Just scroll through the posts and find out what technologies I'm interested in and working in -
business and private. 

This blog is made with [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) (standard theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) at the moment) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's easy to use, easy to modify and customize for your own needs. 

The best part of it? You can find a post on this blog on how to start your own blog with `jekyll` and GitHub Pages.
